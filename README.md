# RL Model Builder 6.0

An advanced reinforcement learning framework for building and training AI models for fundamental physics theory discovery.

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated RL-based system that uses language models to generate and evaluate physics theories. The system combines:

- **TheoryGPT Architecture**: A custom GPT-based model optimized for physics theory generation
- **Grammar-Based Generation**: Structured generation of physics theories using formal grammar rules
- **GRPO Training**: Group Relative Policy Optimization for reinforcement learning
- **Physics Reward Functions**: Automated evaluation of generated theories based on physical constraints

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate
```
